This is the beginning of learning Docker from basics. 

**Docker** is a tool used to automate the deployments of an application in lightweight containers so that application can work efficiently in different environments 

### Features:

 - Multiple containers can run on the same hardware
 - high productivity as it uses the same kernel as of the os 
 - maintains isolated applications so that thier dependencies do clash with each other
 - Ouick and easily configurable virtual machines
 - We can share our images with other users very easily 

## Installation of Docker in Linux :

To install docker in Linux type the following set of commands

```shell 

// adding repository for downloading CE version of repository
$ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh

// Just run this command for automated script to get executed
$ sudo sh get-docker.sh

// To verify your installation try this -
sudo docker run docker/whalesay cowsay Hello-from-docker!

// You will show a message "Hello from Docker!"
